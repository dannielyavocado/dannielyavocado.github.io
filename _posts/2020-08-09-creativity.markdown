I've decided to become a software engineer because I enjoy creating things and paying attention to details. I am also inspired by how technology is changing the world. I also love the feeling of solving things and figuring out solutions and the intelligence behind coding. I am really excited to be on this journey and can't wait for what is stored for me ahead!
